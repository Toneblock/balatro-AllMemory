# All Memory
Customizable challenge mod for hiding Balatro UI features

Mod compatibility is generally unknown, but you can report issues relating to such if you find any.

# Explanation

This mod has a config (MODS -> AllMemory -> Config) where you can hide various aspects of Balatro's UI, leaving it up to prior memory, deduction, or intuition.

# Features

- **Hide all tooltips:** Hides every single tooltip in the game. 
> Can you remember what everything does? Not actually that big of a deal for the skilled balatro player
<br>
  
- **Exclude certain tooltips:* For the above option, excludes hiding certain tooltips that are required for perfect information (e.g. To-Do List). 
> Breaks immersion slightly
<br>

- **Hide Boss Blind effects:** Hides Boss Blind effects. Also removes the warning for playing disallowed hands 
> Very similar to tooltips in both flavour and difficulty
<br>

- **Hide deck information:** Hides forms of deck peeking, both hovering and clicking on the deck. 
> It's just like the early demos!
<br>

- **Hide buy costs and sell values:**
> Can be fun combined with other stuff
<br>

- **Hide score requirements:** Hides all score requirements, everywhere.
> This one's my personal favourite. Makes you pretty paranoid
<br>

- **Hide current money:** 
> If you're good at keeping track, this one's barely a problem, and there's a lot of things you can deduce it from
<br>

- **Hide poker hand information:** Hides all poker hand information, so levels, chips, mult, and times played. 
> I don't like the fact that you can see chips/mult at scoring, but still, good luck playing obelisk with this
<br>

- **Hide hands and discards:** 
> More annoying than difficult. Can still be kinda fun
<br>

- **Hide ante and round:**
> Goes great with hiding score requirements, otherwise doesn't do much
<br>

- **Hide card amount and limit info:** Hides deck, joker, hand, and consumable slots+limits.
> Generally on the annoying side but the deck thing can be good if you're also hiding deck information
<br>

- **Hide score:** Hides current/total score, and current chips/mult.
> This one's fun and works very well with other options, probably the wildest option
